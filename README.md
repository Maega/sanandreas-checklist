# SanAndreas-Checklist

A comprehensive 100% checklist for GTA San Andreas

This project uses the localStorage Web API to remember your progress, so you can tick some checkboxes and come back later to resume where you left off.

There's a basic 100% progress counter ((numSelected/numTotal) * 100) in the top left so you can track how far away you are from completing the game.
Keep in mind this counter is tracked differently in game, so don't worry if you see a different percentage in the stats menu.

## :information_source: Usage

Clone or download this repo and run _index.html_ directly or host it from any web server. It's as easy as that.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Maega/sanandreas-checklist
```
